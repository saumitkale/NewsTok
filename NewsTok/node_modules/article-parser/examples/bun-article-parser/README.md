# bun-article-parser

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install --backend=copyfile
```

*I don't know why `bun install` doesn't work on my environment ([oven-sh/bun#1248](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/1248))*

Start server:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

Open `http://localhost:3100/?url=https://dev.to/ndaidong/how-to-make-your-mongodb-container-more-secure-1646` to see the result.
